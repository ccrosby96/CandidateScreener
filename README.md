# CandidateScreener

This project serves to identify potential candidates in the market given a number of parameters. The need for identifying good candidates for a buy/write strategy neccessitated
the development of this project. With the help of the EOD Historical API, this program enables the user to filter stocks in the market place by market cap, industry, sector, 
5 day percent gain/loss, and a number of criteria related to a stock's option chain. Specifically, the Screener allows one to check for the existance of an option chain with calls
of a given Implied volatility.
